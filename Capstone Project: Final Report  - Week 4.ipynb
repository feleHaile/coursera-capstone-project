And with geospatial data provided in the csv http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data from the Capstone Project course of Coursera and IBM we will append the latitude and longitude from postal codes to our table previously extracted. Finally we will use the location data from Foursquare to identify wich categories of venues are more contained in each neighborhood to then clustering this data and so identify the principals caregories of venues contained in each neighborhood\u2019s cluster.
